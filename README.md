3DC5S or 'Three Dimensional Cascading Style Sheets Space Station Simulator' is a game where the only objective is to build a cool looking space station, by unlocking modules, managing resources, and sticking blocks together.

WASD or ZQSD to move around, click and drag in space to rotate, and click on an item in the build bar, and then on a side of the starting block to get building.

In the menu on the left you can modify the primary, secondary, and accent colours of your station and ships, as well as save/load to localStorage, and import/export the save as JSON.

Chrome and Edge performance is significantly better than in Firefox, and it's untested in Safari.
